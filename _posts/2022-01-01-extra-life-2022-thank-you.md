Dear Southern Alberta Extra Life Participants,

I am pleased to report that this year’s Extra Life event was a tremendous success, thanks to the hard work and dedication of our guild, participants that selected the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation and the generous support of our donors.

As you know, our goal this year was to raise funds for the Alberta Children’s Hospital by committing to playing games, and I am thrilled to announce that we raised an incredible amount. Thanks to your efforts, we were able to raise over $124,000 for the hospital (as of November 9th).

I want to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for your contributions to this year’s event. Your passion and commitment to helping sick and injured children is truly inspiring, and it is because of your efforts that we were able to make such a significant impact.

I also want to extend a special thank you to our community partners, Alberta Esports Association, Video Game Trader, BCI Games, and Endless ERA, who all helped us spread the word about Extra Life and provided invaluable support throughout the year.

As we reflect on the success of 2022’s Extra Life event, I am filled with hope and optimism for the future. I have no doubt that with your continued support, we will be able to achieve even greater things in the years ahead.

Thank you again for your dedication and commitment to Extra life and the children of Alberta Children’s Hospital.

Sincerely,
Todd Willsie
President, Extra Life Calgary Guild
