# Extra Life YYC Website

Thank you for checking out our repository for the Extra Life Calgary guild website. The Calgary Guild helps raise funds for the Alberta Children's Hospital located in Calgary AB, Canada.

If you're a local web developer or someone that's learning programming, we welcome you to help on our website and other projects we use to help local video gamers to raise money and awareness for the hospital.

## How Can I Help On This Project?

If you know or are learning JS, HTML, CSS, Jekyll you can help directly! This repository is using the fork and pull model of development. If you see a change you want to make just fork this project, make your changes commit them and issue a pull request, an experienced dev will review your request and merge the code in if it's good. If you are an experienced developer and you are added as a collaborator to the project just create a topic branch, make your changes and issue a pull request.

If you're an artist, designer or writer we encourage you to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/hZuk3xq) where we can work with you to get you access to help with design work.

## What's the Roadmap

We don't have a real big road map as right now the website is designed to communicate our Extra Life Rockies Game Day event on November 7, 2020. But after that we'll be working on adding the following features to our site

+ News/Blog Section using jekyll to highlight news and gaming events that help kids
+ Google Calendar integration to automate showing off events on the website
+ Dedicated Rockies landing page for 2021
+ Useful tools page for gamers trying to support Alberta Children's Hospital
