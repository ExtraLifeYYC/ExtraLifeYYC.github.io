                                    You can help us reach our $20,000 USD funding goal in a couple of ways. If you love to game, we encourage you and your friends to join the Calgary Guild this year. All we ask is that you commit to 24 hours of gameplay and ask your friends and family to donate to support you as you play games for the Alberta Children’s Hospital. You can also show your support and love for the Alberta Children’s Hospital by clicking on the donate button below. 100% of all proceeds go directly to the Alberta Children’s Hospital.
